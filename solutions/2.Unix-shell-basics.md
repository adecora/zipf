## 2.10.1. Explore more ls flags
`ls -l -h -F --group-directories-first`
- **-l:** long listing format.
- **-h:** human readable.
- **-F:** append indicator (\*/=>@|) to entries.

## 2.10.2. Listing recursively and by time
`ls -R -t`
- **-R:** list subdirectories recursively.
- **-t:** sort by modification time, newest first.

## 2.10.3. Absolute and relative paths
Navigate from `/Users/amira/data` to `/Users/amira`.
1. `cd .` **NO** stands for the current directory.
2. `cd /` **NO** moves to the root directory.
3. `cd /home/amira` **NO** not the right directory.
4. `cd ../..` **NO** moves two directories up, ends on /Users.
5. `cd ~` **YES** stands for the home's amira directory.
6. `cd home`**NO**.
7. `cd ~/data/..`**YES**.
8. `cd`**YES** with no arguments moves to the home's amira directory.
9. `cd ..`**YES**.
10. `cd ../.`**YES**.

## 2.10.4. Relative path solution
```bash
$ pwd
/Users/sami
```

What will `ls -F .../backup	` display?

![image](https://merely-useful.tech/py-rse/figures/bash-basics/exercise-filesystem.png) 

`data/ analysis/ doc/`

## 2.10.5. ls reading comprehension
If `pwd` displays `/Users/backup`, and `-r` tells `ls` to display things in reverse order, what command (s) will result in the following output:

`doc/ data/ analysis/`

1. `ls pwd` **NO** prints directories on rigth order.
2. `ls -r -F`**YES** prints using relative paths.
3. `ls -r -F /Users/backup`**YES** prints using absolute paths.

## 2.10.6. Creating files a different way
`touch my_file.txt` updates file timestamp, if no file exits will create one.

## 2.10.7. Using rm safely
`rm -i my_file.txt` this will prompt the user for confirmation before remove the file.

## 2.10.8. Moving to the current folder
```bash
$ ls -F
data/ docs/

$ ls -F data
README.md           frankenstein.txt        sherlock_holmes.txt
chapter1.txt        jane_eyre.txt           time_machine.txt
chapter2.txt        moby_dick.txt
dracula.txt         sense_and_sensibility.txt

$ cd docs

# Move chapter1.txt chapter2.txt files to the current folder
$ mv ../data/chapter{1,2}.txt .
```

## 2.10.9. Renaming files
Rename **statstics.txt** file to correct the name.
`mv statstics.txt statistics.txt`

## 2.10.10. Moving and copying
```bash
$ pwd
/Users/amira/data

$ ls
books.dat

$ mkdir doc
$ mv books.dat doc/
$ cp doc/books.dat ../books-saved.dat

# What is the output of the closing ls command?
$ ls
doc
```

## 2.10.11. Copy with multiple filenames
Explore how `cp` responds when attempting to copy multiple things.

```bash
$ mkdir backup
$ cp dracula.txt frankenstein.txt backup/

$ cp dracula.txt frankenstein.txt jane_eyre.txt
cp: target 'jane_eyre.txt' is not a directory
```

If more than two arguments are provided to `cp` and the last one is not a directory name it will complain.

## 2.10.12. List filenames matching a pattern
- **\*:** It maches zero or more characters.
- **?:** It matches one character.
When you run in the **data** directory `ls`, which command produce this ouput?

`jane_eyre.txt sense_and_sensibility.txt`

```bash
$ pwd
/Users/amira/data

$ ls
dracula.txt       jane_eyre.txt  README.md                  sherlock_holmes.txt
frankenstein.txt  moby_dick.txt  sense_and_sensibility.txt  time_machine.txt
```

1. `ls ??n*.txt`**YES**.
2. `ls *e_*.txt`**NO** includes desired files but also *time_machine.txt*.
3. `ls *n*.txt`**NO** apart from desired files also include *time_machine.txt* and *frankenstein.txt*.
5. `ls *n?e*.txt`**NO** the output includes *frankenstein.txt* and *sense_and_sensibility.txt*.

## 2.10.13. Organizing directories and files
```bash
$ ls -F
books.txt data/ results/ titles.txt
```

What command(s) you need to produce the output shown?

```bash
$ ls -F
data/ results/

$ ls results
books.txt titles.txt
```

`mv books.txt titles.txt results/`

## 2.10.14. Reproduce a directory structure
The goal is to copy the folder strtucture of **2016-05-18/data** into a folder called **2016-05-20** so that your final directory structure looks like this:
```bash
2016-05-20/
└── data
    ├── processed
    └── raw
```

```bash
# Set 1
$ mkdir 2016-05-20
$ mkdir 2016-05-20/data
$ mkdir 2016-05-20/data/processed
$ mkdir 2016-05-20/data/raw

# YES it works.
```

```bash
# Set 2
$ mkdir 2016-05-20
$ cd 2016-05-20
$ mkdir data
$ cd data
$ mkdir raw processed

# YES it works.
```

```bash
# Set 3
$ mkdir 2016-05-20/data/raw
$ mkdir 2016-05-20/data/processed

# NO it fails.
# It can not create raw folder if data and 2016-05-20 parent folders doesn' exist.
# -p flag solves this, make the parent directories as needed.
```

```bash
# Set 4
$ mkdir 2016-05-20
$ cd 2016-05-20
$ mkdir data
$ mkdir raw processed

# NO it fails.
# This creates raw and processed folders on the same level that data folder.
```

## 2.10.15. Wildcard expressions
Wildcard expression `[st]*.txt`  matches all files beginning with `s` or `t` and ending with `.txt`.

1. Can you match the same set of files with a wildcard that not use `[]` syntax?
```bash
$ ls s*.tx t*.txt 
$ ls {s,t}*.txt
```

2. Under what circumstances would your new expression produce an error message where the original one would not?
If there is no matches for one of the started characters, *zsh: no matches found: s*.txt*.

## 2.10.16. Removing unneeded files
Suppose a process where raw files end in **.txt** and the processed files end in **.csv**. Which of the following would remove all processed data files, and only the processed data files?
1. `rm ?.csv`**NO** It only removes files with one-character names.
2. `rm *.csv`**YES** This works.
3. `rm * .csv`**NO** Wilcard matches all files and second argument try to removes a file name .csv.
4. `rm *.*`**NO** It removes all files with any extension.

## 2.10.17. Other wildcards
Explore shell wildcards with the expression `novel-????-[ab]*.{txt,pdf}`.
It matches any files start with **novel-** followed by four characters **????** then must come an hypen **-** the come a set of chacaters that must start by a or b **[ab]\*** and must have txt or pdf extension **.{txt,pdf}**.
