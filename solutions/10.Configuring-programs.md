## 10.8.1. Building with plotting parameters
In the `Makefile` created, the build rule involving `plotcounts.py` was defined as:
```make
## results/collated.png : plot the collated results.
results/collated.png : results/collated.csv
	python $(PLOT) $< --outfile $@
```

Update that build rule to inlcude the new `--plotparams` option. Make sure `plotparams.yml` is added as a second prerequisite in the updated build rule so that the appropriate commands will be re-run if the plotting parameters change

***Hint**: We use the automatic variable $< to access the first prerequisite, but you'll need  `\$(word 2, \$^)` to access the second. Read about automatic variables (Section **9.5**) and [functions for string substitution and analysis](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Text-Functions.html#Text-Functions) to understand what that command is doing.* 

```make
PARAMS=bin/plotparams.yml
```

```make
## results/collated.png: plot the collated results.
results/collated.png : results/collated.csv $(PARAMS) $(PLOT)
	python $(PLOT) $< --plotparams $(word 2, $^) --outfile $@
```

```make
## settings : show variables' values.
settings : 
         @echo COUNT: $(COUNT)
         @echo DATA: $(DATA)
         @echo RESULTS: $(RESULTS)
         @echo COLLATE: $(COLLATE)
         @echo PARAMS: $(PARAMS)
         @echo PLOT: $(PLOT)
         @echo SUMMARY: $(SUMMARY)
         @echo MAKEFILE_LIST: ${MAKEFILE_LIST}
```

## 10.8.2. Using different plot styles
There are many pre-defined matplotlib styles (Section **10.4**), as illustrated at the [Python Graph Gallery](https://www.python-graph-gallery.com/199-matplotlib-style-sheets).
1. Add a new option `--style` to `plotcounts.py` that allows the user to pick from the list of pre-defined matplotlib styles.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

```python
	parser.add_argument('--style', type=str, default=None,
						choices=plt.style.available,
						help='matplotlib style')
```

```python
def main(args):
    """Run the command line program."""
		if args.style:
    	plt.style.use(args.style)
```

***Hint:** Use the `choices` parameter discussed in Section **10.5** to define the valid choices for the nmew `--style` option*.

2. Re-generate the plot of the Jane Eyre word count distribution using a bunch of different styles to decide which you like best.
3. Matplotlib style sheets are designed to be composed together. (See the [style sheets tutorial](https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/introductory/customizing.html) for details.) Use the `nargs` parameter to allow the user to pass any number of styles when using the `--style` option.

```python
	parser.add_argument('--style', type=str, 
						nargs='*', default=None,
						choices=plt.style.available,
						help='matplotlib style')
```

## 10.8.3. Saving configurations
1. Add an option `--saveconfig filename` to `plotcounts.py` that writes all of its configuration to a file. Make sure this option saves all of the configuration, including any defaults that the user hasn't change.

```python
	parser.add_argument('--saveconfig', type=argparse.FileType('w'),
                        default=None,
                        help='Save configuration to file')
```

```python
def save_configuration(file, params):
     """Save configuration to a file."""
     yaml.dump(params, file)

def main(args):
    """Run the command line program."""
    if args.style:
    	plt.style.use(args.style)
    set_plot_params(args.plotparams)
    if args.saveconfig:
        save_configuration(args.saveconfig, mpl.rcParams)
    plotcounts(args.infile, args.outfile, args.xlim)
```

2. Add a new target `test-saveconfig` to the `Makefile` created in Chapter **9** to test that the new option is working.

```make
.PHONY : all results test-config clean help settings
```

```make
## test-saveconfig : saves plot configuration.
test-saveconfig : results/collated.csv $(PLOT)
	python $(PLOT) $< --saveconfig testconfig.yml
```

3. How would this new `--saveconfig` option make your work more reproducible?

```yaml
!!python/object/new:matplotlib.RcParams
dictitems:
  _internal.classic_mode: false
  agg.path.chunksize: 0
  animation.bitrate: -1
  animation.codec: h264
  animation.convert_args:
  - -layers
  - OptimizePlus
  animation.convert_path: convert
  ...
```

Entries are automatically sorted alphabetically, which make it easy for both human beings and the `diff` command to spot differences. This helps reproducibility because any of these settings might change in a new release of  `matplotlib`, and any of those changes might affect our plots. Saving the settings allows us to compare what we had when we did our work to what we have when we're trying to re-create it, which in turn gives us a starting point for debugging if we need to.

## 10.8.4. Using INI syntax
If we used [Windows INI format]() instead of YAML for our plot parameters configuration file (i.e., `plotparams.ini` instead `plotparams.yml`) that file would read as follows:
```ini
[AXES]
axes.labelsize=x-large

[TICKS]
xtick.labelsize=large
ytick.labelsize=large
```

The [configparser](https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html) library can be used to read and write INI files. Install that library by running `pip install configparser` at the command line.
Usinf `configparser`, rewrite the `set_plot_params` function in `plotcount.py` to handle a configuration file INI rather than a YAML format.

```python
import configparser
```

```python
def set_plot_params(param_file):
     """Set the matplotlib parameters."""
     if param_file:
					config = configparser.ConfigParser()
         config.read(param_file)
         for section in config.sections():
             for key in config[section]:
                 mpl.rcParams[key] = config[section][key]
```

***Note**: the code modified in this excercise is not required for the rest of the book.*

1. Which file format do you find easier to work with?
**Windows INI files** are easier to write and read, since it's easier to see what's a heading and what's a value.

2. What other factors should influence your choice of a configuration file syntax?
**Windows INI files** only provides one level of sectioning, so complex configurations are harder to express. Thus, while **YAML** may be a bit more difficult to get started with, it will take us further.


## 10.8.5. Configuration consistency
In order for a data processing pipeline to work correctly, some of the configuration parameters for Program A and Program B must be the same. However, the programs were written by different teams, and each has its own configuration file. What steps could you take to ensure the required consistency?

If we can, we can modify them tu use overlay configuration, and put the shared parameters in a single file that both programs load. If we can't do that, the next best thing is to create a small helper program that reads their configuration files and checks that common parameters have consistent values. *First solution prevents the problem, the second detects it, which is a lot better than nothing.*
