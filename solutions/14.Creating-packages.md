## 14.9.1. Package metadata
In a number of places on our TestPyPi webpage, it says that no project description was provided. How could we edit our **setup.py** file to include a description? What other metadata would you add?

*Hint: The [`setup () args` documentation](https://packaging.python.org/guides/distributing-packages-using-setuptools/#setup-args) might be useful.*

```python
from setuptools import setup

with open('./README.rst', 'r') as reader:
    long_description = reader.read()

setup(
    name='pyzipf-cora',
    version='0.1.1',
    author='Alejandro de Cora',
    description="Zipf's Law",
    long_description=long_description,
    long_description_content_type='text/x-rst',
    packages=['pyzipf'],
    install_requires=[
        'matplotlib',
        'pandas',
        'scipy',
        'pyyaml',
        'pytest'],
    entry_points={
        'console_scripts': [
            'countwords = pyzipf.countwords:main',
            'collate = pyzipf.collate:main',
            'plotcounts = pyzipf.plotcounts:main']})
```

```bash
$ python setup.py sdist
$ twine upload --respository testpypi dist/*
```

## 14.9.2. Separating requirements
As well as **requirements_docs.txt**, developers often create a **requirements_dev.txt** file to a list packages that are not needed by the package's users, but are required for its development and testing. Pull `pytest` out of **requirements.txt** and put it in a new **requirements_dev.txt** file.\

After separate requirements we must update out **CI** *(Continuous Integration)* config files.

```yml
# Translate Python workflow from TravisCI to GitHub Actions
name: Python package
on: push

jobs:
    build:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest

        steps:
            - uses: actions/checkout@v3
            - name: Set up Python '3.10'
              uses: actions/setup-python@v4
              with:
                  python-version: '3.10'
            - name: Install dependencies
              run: |
                  python -m pip install --upgrade pip
                  pip install -r requirements.txt
                  pip install -r requirements_dev.txt
            - name: Test with pytest
              run: |
                  pytest
```

```yml
language: python

python:
    - "3.7"

install:
    - pip install -r requirements.txt
    - pip install -r requirements_dev.txt

script:
    - pytest
```

## 14.9.3. Software review
The [Journal of Open Source Software](https://joss.theoj.org/) has a [checklist](https://joss.readthedocs.io/en/latest/review_checklist.html) that reviewers must follow when assessing a submitted software paper. Run through the checklist (skipping the criteria related to the software paper) and see how the Zipf's Law package would rate on each criteria.

### General checks
- *Repository:* Is the source code relevant for this software available at the repository url?
	- Yes. The source code should be available at **PyPI**.
- *License:* Does the repository contain a plain-text **LICENSE** file with the contents of an OSI approved software license?
	- Yes. GitHub repository contains a **LICENSE.md**. 

---
### Functionality
- *Installation:* Does installation proceed as outlined in the documentation? 
	- Yes. Our **README** says the package can be installed via pip.
- *Functionality:* Have the functional claims of the software been confirmed? 
	- Yes. The command-line programs `countwords`, `collate`, and `plotcounts` perform as described in the **README**.
---
### Documentation
- *A statement of need:* Do the authors clearly state what problems the software is designed to solve and who the target audience is?
	- Yes. The *"Motivation"* section of the **README** explains this.
- *Installation instructions:* Is there a clearly stated list of dependencies? Ideally these should be handled with an automated package management solution. 
	- Yes. In our `setup.py` file the `install_requires` argument list dependencies.
- *Example usage:* Do the authors include examples of how to use the software (ideally to solve real-world analysis problems). 
	- Yes. There are examples in the **README**.
- *Functionality documentation:* Is the core functionality of the software documented to a satisfactory level (e.g., API method documentation)?
	- Yes. This information is available on *Read the Docs*.
- *Automated tests:* Are there automated tests or manual steps described so that the functionality of the software can be verified? 
	- Yes. We have unit tests written and available (`test_zipfs.py`), but our documentation needs to be updated to tell people to run `pytest` in order to manually run those tests.
- *Community guidelines:* Are there clear guidelines for third parties wishing to 1) Contribute to the software 2) Report issues or problems with the software 3) Seek support? 
	- Yes. Our **CONTRIBUTING** file explains this.



## 14.9.4. Packaging quotations
Each chapter in this book opens with a quote from the British author Terry Pratchett. This script **quote.py** contains a function `random_quote` which prints a random Pratchett quote:
```python
import random


quote_list = ["It's still magic even if you know how it's done.",
              "Everything starts somewhere, "\
              "though many physicists disagree.",
              "Ninety percent of most magic merely consists "\
              "of knowing one extra fact.",
              "Wisdom comes from experience. "\
              "Experience is often a result of lack of wisdom.",
              "There isn't a way things should be. "\
              "There's just what happens, and what we do.",
              "Multiple exclamation marks are a sure sign "\
              "of a diseased mind.",
              "+++ Divide By Cucumber Error. "\
              "Please Reinstall Universe And Reboot +++",
              "It's got three keyboards and a hundred extra "\
              "knobs, including twelve with ‘?' on them.",
			 ]


def random_quote():
	"""Print a random Pratchett quote."""
	print(random.choice(quote_list))
```

Create a new `conda` development environment called `pratchett` and use `pip` toinstall a new package called `pratchett` into that environment. The package should contain **quotes.py**, and once the package has been installed the user should be able to run:
```python
from pratchett import quotes

quotes.random_quote()
```

Our directory tree for the **pratchett** package looks like:

```bash
$ tree pratchett 
pratchett
├── pratchett
│   └── quotes.py
└── setup.py
```

*We should add a **README.md** file with a basic description fo the package and how install/use it*

```python
from setuptools import setup

setup(
    name='pratchett',
    version='0.1',
    author='Alejandro de Cora',
    packages=['pratchett'],
    entry_points={
        'console_scripts': [
            'random_quote = pratchett.quotes:random_quote']})
```

Now we can create an empty environment, active it, and install the package.

```bash
$ conda create -n pratchett pip python=3.7
$ conda activate pratchett

(pratchett)$ cd pratchett
(pratchett)$ pip install -e .
(pratchett)$ random_quote
Ninety percent of most magic merely consists of knowing one extra fact.
```
