## 3.8.1. What does `>>` mean?
Test the commands below to reveal the difference between the two operators:
```bash
$ echo hello > testfile01.txt

# and
 
$ echo hello >> testfile02.txt
```
 
If the file already exist `>>` append the content to the file, while `>` overwrites the file each time we run the command.
 
```bash
$ echo hello > testfile01.txt
$ echo hello > testfile01.txt
$ batcat testfile01.txt
hello
 
$ echo hello > testfile01.txt
$ echo hello > testfile01.txt
$ batcat testfile02.txt
hello
hello
```
 
 
## 3.8.2. Appending data
Given the following commands, what will be included in the file **extracted.txt**:
```bash
$ head -n 3 dracula.txt > extracted.txt
$ rail -n 2 dracula.txt >> extracted.txt
```

It will include the **first three lines and the last two** from **dracula.txt**. First command creates the file **extracted.txt** with the first three lines of **dracula.txt** and the second command appends the last two lines of **dracula.txt** to the same file.

## 3.8.3. Piping commands
Which command will work to find the 3 files which have the least number of lines?
1. `wc -l * > sort -n > head -n 3`**NO** `>` is used to redirect `stdout` to a file no pipe it to next command.
2. `wc -l * | sort -n | head -n 1-3`**NO** we can not use a range on head's -n option.
3. `wc -l * | head -n 3 | sort -n`**NO** we are sorting the 3 first files output by the `wc -l *` which are alphabetically sorted.
4. `wc -l * | sort -n | head -n 3`**YES**.

## 3.8.4. Why does `uniq` only remove adjacent duplicates?
The command `uniq` removes adjacent duplicated lines from its input. Consider a hypothetical files `genres.txt` containing the following data:
```bash
science fiction
fantasy
science fiction
fantasy
science fiction
science fiction
```

Running the command `uniq genres.txt` produces:
```bash
science fiction
fantasy
science fiction
fantasy
science fiction
```

To remove all duplicate lines we must combine it with `sort`.
```bash
$ sort genres.txt | uniq
```

This allows the computer to compare only adjacent lines.
If `uniq` did not compare only adjacent lines, it would require compare each line to all other lines, this will be really costly for large files.

## 3.8.5. Pipe reading comprehension
A fille called **tittles.txt** contains a list of book titles and publication years:
```bash
Dracula,1897
Frankenstein,1818
Jane Eyre,1847
Moby Dick,1851
Sense and Sensibility,1811
The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes,1892
The Invisible Man,1897
The Time Machine,1895
Wuthering Heights,1847
```

What text passes through each of the pipes and the final redirect in the pipeline below?
```bash
$ cat titles.txt | head -n 5 | tail -n 3 | sort -r > final.txt
```

Let's break the pipeline in steps
```bash
$ cat titles.txt | head -n 5
Dracula,1897
Frankenstein,1818
Jane Eyre,1847
Moby Dick,1851
Sense and Sensibility,1811

$ cat titles.txt | head -n 5 | tail -n 3
Jane Eyre,1847
Moby Dick,1851
Sense and Sensibility,1811

$ cat titles.txt | head -n 5 | tail -n 3 | sort -r
Sense and Sensibility,1811
Moby Dick,1851
Jane Eyre,1847
```

## 3.8.6. Pipe construction
For the **tittles.txt** from the previous exercise, consider the following command:
```bash
$ cut -d , -f 2 titles.txt
```

`cut` remove sections from each line of files.
- **-d \[delimiter\]:** Use **delimiter** instead **TAB**.
- **-f \[list\]:** Select only **list** fields/columns, also prints any line that contains no delimiter character unless the **-s** option is specified.

```bash
$ cut -d , -f 2 titles.txt
1897
1818
1847
1851
1811
1892
1897
1895
1847
```

## 3.8.7. Which pipe?
Consider the same **titles.txt** from the previous excercises.
`uniq` command has a `-c` option which gives a count of the number of times a line occurs in its input. If **titles.txt** was in your working directory what command would you use to produce a table that shows the total count of each publication year in the file?

1. `sort titles.txt | uniq -c`**NO** We must remove book titles from the file.
2. `sort -t, -k2,2 titles.txt | uniq -c`**NO*** It does the order right by the second field delimited by comma, but in order to get the right count with uniq the title must be remove from the file.
3. `cut -d, -f 2 titles.txt | uniq -c`**NO**. We must sort the years before uniq is applied to remove all duplicates.
4. `cut -d, -f 2 titles.txt | sort | uniq -c`**YES**
5. `cut -d, -f 2 titles.txt | sort | uniq -c | wc -l`**NO**This count the number of lines of the right result.

## 3.8.8. Doing a dry run
One way to check a loop would do is to `echo` the commands it would run instead of actually running them.
Suppose we want to preview the commands the following loop will execute without actually running those commands (`analyze` is a hypothetical command):
```bash
$ for file in *.txt
> do
> 	echo analyze $file > analyzed-$file
> done
```

What is the difference between the two loops below, and which one would we want to run?
```bash
$ for file in *.txt
> do
> 	echo analyze $file > analyzed-$file
> done
```
First loop will `echo` *analyze \$file* and redirects the output to a file **analyze-\$file**, this is not the intended and doesn't allow us to preview the commands.

or:
```bash
$ for file in *.txt
> do
> 	echo "analyze $file > analyzed-$file"
> done
```
This loop will `echo` the `analyze` command that the loop will execute.

## 3.8.9. Variables in loops
Given the files in **data/**, what is the output of the following code?
```bash
$ for datafile in *.txt
> do
> 	ls *.txt
> done
# There is 7 txt files on data's directory this will print te same output (all files list) 7 times.
dracula.txt  frankenstein.txt  jane_eyre.txt  moby_dick.txt  sense_and_sensibility.txt  sherlock_holmes.txt  time_machine.txt
dracula.txt  frankenstein.txt  jane_eyre.txt  moby_dick.txt  sense_and_sensibility.txt  sherlock_holmes.txt  time_machine.txt
dracula.txt  frankenstein.txt  jane_eyre.txt  moby_dick.txt  sense_and_sensibility.txt  sherlock_holmes.txt  time_machine.txt
dracula.txt  frankenstein.txt  jane_eyre.txt  moby_dick.txt  sense_and_sensibility.txt  sherlock_holmes.txt  time_machine.txt
dracula.txt  frankenstein.txt  jane_eyre.txt  moby_dick.txt  sense_and_sensibility.txt  sherlock_holmes.txt  time_machine.txt
dracula.txt  frankenstein.txt  jane_eyre.txt  moby_dick.txt  sense_and_sensibility.txt  sherlock_holmes.txt  time_machine.txt
dracula.txt  frankenstein.txt  jane_eyre.txt  moby_dick.txt  sense_and_sensibility.txt  sherlock_holmes.txt  time_machine.txt
```

Now, what is the uotput of the following code?
```bash
$ for datafile in *.txt
> do
> 	ls $datafile
> done
# This print the right list of files under data's directory.
dracula.txt
frankenstein.txt
jane_eyre.txt
moby_dick.txt
sense_and_sensibility.txt
sherlock_holmes.txt
time_machine.txt
```

## 3.8.10. Limiting sets of files
What would be the output of running the following loop in your 
**data/** directory?
```bash
$ for filename in d*
> do
> 	ls $filename
> done
# This will loop for all files which filename starts by a "d".
dracula.txt
```

How would the output differ from usiong this command instead?
```bash
$ for filename in *d*
> do
> 	ls $filename
> done
# This will loop for al files which contains a "d" with zero or more characters before and after.
dracula.txt
moby_dick.txt
README.md
sense_and_sensibility.txt
```

## 3.8.11. Saving to a file in a loop
Consider the following loop in **data/** directory:
```bash
for book in *.txt
> do
> 	echo $book
>  head -n 16 $book > headers.txt
> done
```

Why would the following loop be prefereable?
```bash
for book in *.txt
> do
>  head -n 16 $book >> headers.txt
> done
```

First loop will only contain the result of the last book because `>` redirection will overwrite **headers.txt** in each iteration.
The second version uses `>>`, which appends the lines to the existing file.

## 3.8.12. Why does `history` record commands before running them?
If you run the command:
```bash
$ history | tail -n 5 > recent.sh
```

the last command in the file is the `history` itself, i.e., the shell has added `history` to the command log before actually running it. In fact, the shell always adds commands to the log before running them. Why would you think it does this?

If a command causes something to crash or hang, it might be useful to know what that command was, in order to investigate the problem. Were the command only be recorded after running it, we would not have a record of the last command run in the event of a crash.
